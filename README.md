__The Game__
A random number between 0 and 9 is set.
You must guess this number by pressing the number keys.
If you get it correct, the tank will move away from your car, and your score will increase by 1.
If you get it incorrect, the tank will move forward.
If the tank hits your car, it will be destroyed and it is game over.
